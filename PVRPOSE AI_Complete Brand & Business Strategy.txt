## BUSINESS OVERVIEW

### What PVRPOSE AI Does

PVRPOSE AI is an AI implementation consulting firm specializing in helping service businesses (coaches, consultants, agencies) implement AI automation without losing their humanity or burning out.

### The Problem We Solve

**Market Pain Points (Feb 2026):**
- Approximately 80% of businesses are not ready for AI adoption due to maturity gaps and lack of clear implementation pathways
- Most AI consultants take 6-12 months and charge $100K+ for enterprise implementations
- Generic AI solutions don't match how businesses actually operate
- Business owners fear becoming "full-time prompt engineers"
- High risk of burnout during AI transformation

**What Makes This Urgent:**
- McKinsey: AI-leading companies achieve 1.5× revenue growth and 1.6× shareholder returns
- 87% of tech leaders plan to increase AI investment in 2026 (VivaTech 2026 report)
- McKinsey projects $2.9 trillion in US economic value by 2030 from AI-driven productivity gains
- Gartner estimates global AI spending at $2 trillion+ in 2026, up from $1.5 trillion in 2025
- Mid-market service businesses are underserved (too small for big consultancies, too complex for DIY tools)

### The Solution

**PVRPOSE AI delivers:**
1. **Fast implementation** — 6-8 weeks vs 6-12 months
2. **Affordable pricing** — $15K-$25K vs $100K+
3. **Human-centered approach** — AI that matches how you think, not generic templates
4. **Agile delivery** — Sprint-based with weekly check-ins
5. **Sustainability focus** — Prevents founder burnout during transformation

## UNIQUE METHODOLOGY

### The "Vibe Coding" Approach

**What is Vibe Coding?**

Vibe coding is rapid AI prototyping that builds systems matching how your business actually operates — not generic templates or cookie-cutter solutions.

**Origin:** The term "vibe coding" was coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 and refers to AI-assisted prototyping via natural language prompts, enabling rapid, human-centered development.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Human-Centered Design**
   - AI captures your voice, thinking patterns, decision-making process
   - Systems feel like an extension of you, not a foreign tool
   - Preserves your brand identity and authenticity

2. **Rapid Prototyping**
   - Build working prototypes in 60-90 minute sessions
   - Test with real data immediately
   - Iterate based on actual usage, not assumptions

3. **Agile Delivery**
   - 1-week sprint cycles
   - Weekly demos of working features
   - Continuous feedback and adjustment
   - No "big reveal" at the end — you see progress weekly

4. **Sustainable Implementation**
   - Built-in burnout prevention
   - Realistic timelines that respect team capacity
   - Change management integrated into delivery
   - Focus on adoption, not just deployment

**The Process:**

**Week 1: Discovery & Setup**
- Map current workflows
- Identify automation opportunities
- Set success metrics
- Create sprint backlog

**Weeks 2-7: Build Sprints**
- Monday: Sprint planning (what we're building this week)
- Wednesday: Live vibe coding session (build in real-time with client)
- Friday: Sprint review (demo working features, gather feedback)
- Repeat: Iterate and improve

**Week 8: Training & Handoff**
- Team training
- Documentation delivery
- 30-day support period

**Technology Stack:**
- **Primary:** Claude (Anthropic AI) for natural language processing
- **Development:** Cursor IDE for rapid prototyping
- **Integration:** Make.com, Zapier, custom APIs
- **Deployment:** Client infrastructure or recommended platforms

---

### The "Agile AI" Framework

**Why Agile for AI Implementation?**

Traditional AI projects fail because they:
- Take too long (6-12 months)
- Cost too much ($100K+)
- Deliver everything at once (no early wins)
- Don't adapt to changing needs
- Overwhelm teams with "big bang" launches

**Agile AI Implementation solves this:**
- ✅ Short cycles (1-week sprints)
- ✅ Early wins (working automation in Week 2)
- ✅ Continuous adaptation (change direction based on feedback)
- ✅ Manageable scope (one automation at a time)
- ✅ Team involvement (not "IT project" — business-led)

**Sprint Structure:**

**Sprint Planning (Monday, 1 hour)**
- Review backlog
- Select sprint goal
- Define "done" criteria
- Assign tasks

**Daily Standups (Async, 5 minutes)**
- What did I complete yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- Any blockers?

**Live Build Session (Wednesday, 90 minutes)**
- Vibe coding in real-time
- Client watches/participates
- Immediate feedback
- Quick adjustments

**Sprint Review (Friday, 30 minutes)**
- Demo working features
- Gather feedback
- Adjust priorities for next sprint

**Sprint Retrospective (Friday, 30 minutes)**
- What went well?
- What to improve?
- Action items for next sprint

### The "Human Potential" Layer (Secret Sauce)

**What makes PVRPOSE AI different from other AI consultants:**

Most AI consultants focus only on the technology.  
PVRPOSE AI focuses on **sustainable transformation**.

**The Hidden Problem:**  
AI implementation often triggers:
- Decision fatigue (too many choices)
- Imposter syndrome ("I don't understand this")
- Analysis paralysis (afraid of wrong choice)
- Burnout (adding AI on top of existing workload)

**The PVRPOSE AI Solution:**

**1. Flow State Integration**
- Work in 90-minute focused blocks
- Strategic breaks built into sprint schedule
- Prevent context-switching and meeting overload

**2. Nervous System Awareness**
- Recognize when client is overwhelmed
- Adjust pace and complexity accordingly
- Build psychological safety into the process

**3. Sustainable Pacing**
- Realistic timelines (not "move fast and break things")
- Buffer time for learning and adaptation
- Celebrate small wins (dopamine hits)

**4. Change Management Built-In**
- Team involvement from day one
- Training integrated into delivery (not an afterthought)
- Support during adoption period

**How this shows up in practice:**
- Sprint planning includes "team capacity check" (not just task assignment)
- Live build sessions include breathing breaks
- Friday reviews celebrate progress (not just identify gaps)
- Communication is direct and shame-free ("This is complex, let's break it down")

**Result:**  
Clients don't just get AI systems. They get AI systems they actually use, without burning out their team.

**Note:** This "human potential" layer is delivered naturally during the engagement. It's NOT marketed as "mindfulness coaching" or "breathwork sessions" — those terms would hurt conversion. Instead, it's positioned as "sustainable implementation" and "burnout prevention."

## PRICING STRATEGY

### Pricing Philosophy

**Value-Based Pricing, Not Hourly**

PVRPOSE AI charges based on:
- **Outcome delivered** (time saved, revenue generated)
- **Complexity** (number of systems, integration requirements)
- **Market positioning** (mid-market sweet spot)

**NOT based on:**
- Hours worked
- Developer hourly rates
- "Industry standard" (which doesn't exist yet)

### Price Anchoring

**Context for clients:**
- Enterprise AI consultancies: $100K-$500K (McKinsey, Accenture, Deloitte)
- AI development agencies: $50K-$150K
- DIY AI tools: $0-$500/month (but requires founder to become prompt engineer)
- **PVRPOSE AI: $15K-$25K** (10× cheaper than enterprise, 100× faster than DIY)

### Revenue Projections

**Disclaimer:** These projections are based on conservative industry benchmarks for AI consulting engagements. Actual results will depend on market conditions, sales execution, and client acquisition rates. Projections are updated quarterly.

**Year 1 (2026) Conservative Model:**

**Scenario A: Audit-Heavy**
- 12 audits × $5K = $60K
- 6 implementations × $20K = $120K
- 3 retainers × $5K/month × 6 months = $90K
- **Total: $270K**

**Scenario B: Implementation-Heavy**
- 6 audits × $5K = $30K
- 10 implementations × $20K = $200K
- 5 retainers × $5K/month × 6 months = $150K
- **Total: $380K**

**Target: $300K-$400K in Year 1**

### Payment Terms

**Standard Terms:**
- Audits: 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
- Implementations: 50% upfront, 25% at Week 4, 25% at completion
- Retainers: Monthly, billed on 1st of month

**Early Payment Discount:**
- 5% discount for full payment upfront

**Refund Policy:**
- Audits: Full refund if delivered >30 days late (barring client delays)
- Implementations: Prorated refund if mutual agreement to cancel (rare)
- Retainers: 30-day cancellation notice required

### How Community Feeds Consulting

**The Funnel:**
Free Content (LinkedIn, Newsletter)
↓
Skool Free Tier (Waitlist)
↓
├──→ Paid Community Member ($147-$497/month)
│    └──→ Some realize DIY is too hard → Hire PVRPOSE AI
│
└──→ Skip community → Book $5K Audit
└──→ Upgrade to $15K-$25K Implementation
└──→ Become $3K-$7.5K/month Retainer Client

**Key Insight:**  
Community is NOT a competitor to consulting. It's a:
1. **Lead gen tool** (free tier captures emails)
2. **Pre-qualification mechanism** (engaged members are warmer leads)
3. **Case study generator** (community members become implementation examples)
4. **Thought leadership platform** (proves expertise)

---

### Community Launch Timeline (Proposed)

**Month 1-3 (NOW — March-May 2026):**
- ❌ Do NOT launch community yet
- ✅ Focus 100% on consulting
- ✅ Close 2-3 implementation clients
- ✅ Document process while delivering

**Month 4-6 (June-August 2026):**
- ✅ Create community structure (if still desired)
- ✅ Build first 5-10 training modules from client work
- ✅ Soft launch to email list (if one exists)
- ✅ Free tier only initially

**Month 7-9 (September-November 2026):**
- ✅ Launch paid tier
- ✅ Target: 20-30 paying members
- ✅ Monthly revenue: $3K-$15K

**Month 10-12 (December 2026-February 2027):**
- ✅ Add VIP tier
- ✅ Target: 50 paid + 5 VIP members
- ✅ Monthly revenue: $10K-$30K

**Key Decision Point:**  
After first 2-3 consulting clients, Juan will decide:
- Continue consulting only? (No community)
- Add community as lead gen? (Scenario A)
- Build training business? (Scenario B)

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

### What Makes PVRPOSE AI Unique

**1. Agile + AI Integration**
- Most AI consultants don't use Agile methodology
- Most Agile consultants don't understand AI implementation
- Juan has 15+ years Agile + hands-on AI skills = rare combination

**2. Vibe Coding Methodology**
- Emerging term coined by Andrej Karpathy (February 2025)
- Market is already using it for rapid AI prototyping
- Juan can claim premium ownership of "structured vibe coding"
- Live prototyping in client sessions (not "deliver and disappear")

**3. Human-Centered Sustainability**
- Prevents founder burnout during AI transformation
- Not just "move fast and break things"
- Flow states, nervous system awareness, sustainable pacing
- (Delivered naturally, not marketed as "coaching")

**4. Speed + Affordability**
- 6-8 weeks vs 6-12 months (enterprise)
- $15K-$25K vs $100K+ (enterprise)
- Mid-market sweet spot (underserved by big consultancies)

**5. Service Business Specialization**
- Deep understanding of coach/consultant/agency operations
- Not generic "AI for any business"
- Automation patterns specific to service delivery

---

### Competitive Moats

**What's defensible about this business?**

**Short-term moats (0-12 months):**
- ✅ Juan's Agile credentials (15+ years, can't be faked)
- ✅ Early case studies in service business niche
- ✅ Vibe coding brand ownership (if marketed consistently)
- ✅ Network in Agile/coaching community

**Medium-term moats (1-3 years):**
- ✅ Documented methodology (The Vibe Coding Method™)
- ✅ 20-30 case studies across service business types
- ✅ Community of practitioners (if launched)
- ✅ Reputation as "the Agile AI guy"

**Long-term moats (3+ years):**
- ✅ Training program that creates more practitioners (licensing revenue)
- ✅ Book or comprehensive training materials
- ✅ Certification program (Vibe Coding Certified Consultant)
- ✅ Agency model (hiring other consultants to deliver Juan's methodology)

---

---

### Potential Future Competitors

**Who might enter this space in 2026-2027?**
